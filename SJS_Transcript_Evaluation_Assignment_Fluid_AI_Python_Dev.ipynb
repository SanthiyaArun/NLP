        "   - `pickle`: Used for serializing and deserializing Python objects.\n",
        "   - `PdfReader` from `PyPDF2`: Reads and extracts text from PDF files.\n",
        "   - `add_vertical_space`: Adds vertical space in the Streamlit app.\n",
        "   - `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from `langchain.text_splitter`: Splits text into manageable chunks.\n",
        "   - `OpenAIEmbeddings` from `langchain.embeddings.openai`: Generates embeddings using OpenAI.\n",
        "   - `FAISS` from `langchain.vectorstores`: A library for efficient similarity search.\n",
        "   - `OpenAI` from `langchain.llms`: Interacts with OpenAI's language models.\n",
